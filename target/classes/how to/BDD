					How To Build BDD framework

Step-1
build maven framework appropriately
Step -2
configure pom.xml file
Propertiesâ€”		>java version
Dependencies-	->selenium, WebDriverManger, cucumber,junit
plug-ins--->		sure fire plugin
Step-3 		add cucumber plug-in
Step-4 		build feature folder and feature file.Feature files are the core of cucumber data driven testing, as they define the scenarios, steps, and examples that guide the automation and validation of your application's behavior.

step-5 		convert into cucumber frame work
step -6 		Develop cucumber runner file
step-7 		configure runner file. Executes the .feature files and coordinates the steps defined in those .feature files with the corresponding step definitions.
step-8 		run from runner file
step-9 		copy the trace from junit
step 10-		 build step defination package./we call it from page site and put all the method //we are segregeation it
step 11-		 build test defination class
step 12-		 paste the trace and fix it
step 13-		 make sure glue path is right.


					How To Build Runner File

Step-1 build a runner package
Step-2 Develop a runner class
@RunWith=it is basicly junit runner
(Cucumber.class)==run anything with .feature extension
@CucumberOptions()==filter and designing run configuration
plug in== reporting== cucumber report
plugin={"pretty", "html:target/facebookReport.html","xml:target/facebookReport.xml"}
what is feature=file path where all the feature files are
most of the time it will be folder path
but it is possible to go any level
src/test/resources/features/login.feature
what is glue==path of the step defination
most of the time it will be folder path
"com.facebook.stepDefinations"
but it is possible to go any level
"com.facebook.stepDefinations.LoginStep
what is tag== grouping such as @smoke
can you run mulitple tag at the same time=yes{"@smoke", "@regrassion"}
tagging condition= and, or, include, exclude

						How To Develop Cucumber Scenario


build a folder--optional(in side the resources folder)
build feature with .feature extension

As a user== precondition==given
I want to do something==action==When
so that it will work== validation ==Then
As a tester I open facebook application to enter my valid user name and password and I click login button so that i can be logged in
@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@RunWith== run with Junit== follow Junit rules
(Cucumber.class)== run those file who has .feature extension


						Scenario Outline

step -1
.feature file
step-2 write appropriate user input coulum name
in the <> such as <browser>
step-3 build examples
Examples:
| browser | Url | userName | password |



						. feature file
step definition
Runner file
Base step
Login pages or registration pages
